## Site Setup

This site was built with Hugo, and is hosted on Netlify

Some fun facts about [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/):

* Built in [Go](http://golang.org/)
* Loosely inspired by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
* Primarily developed by [spf13](http://spf13.com/) on the train while commuting to and from Manhattan.
* Coded in [Vim](http://vim.org) using [spf13-vim](http://vim.spf13.com/)
